Let's deploy a project using Mina.

### Step 1: Create a config/deploy.rb

In your project, type `mina init` to create a sample of this file.

    $ mina init
    Created config/deploy.rb.

<br clear='all' />

This is just a Rake file with tasks! See [About deploy.rb](#about_deployrb) for 
more info on what *deploy.rb* is. You will want to at least configure your
server:

    # config/deploy.rb
    set :user, 'username'
    set :domain, 'your.server.com'
    set :deploy_to, '/var/www/flipstack.com'
    ...

### Step 2: Set up your server

Make a directory in your server called `/var/www/flipstack.com` (in *deploy_to*)
change it's ownership to the correct user.

    $ ssh username@your.server.com

    # Once in your server, create the deploy folder:
    ~@your.server.com$ mkdir /var/www/flipstack.com
    ~@your.server.com$ chown -R username /var/www/flipstack.com

### Step 3: Run 'mina setup'

Back at your computer, do `mina setup` to set up the [folder 
structure](#directory_structure) in this path. This will connect to your server 
via SSH and create the right directories.

    $ mina setup
    -----> Creating folders... done.

See [directory structure](directory_structure.html) for more info.

### Step 4: Deploy!

Use `mina deploy` to run the `deploy` task defined in *config/deploy.rb*.

    $ mina deploy
    -----> Deploying to 2012-06-12-040248
           ...
           Lots of things happening...
           ...
    -----> Done.
